# SoilDataPrep

Prepare soil input (e.g. for meso-scale hydrological modelling with WASA), using the global datasets SoilGrids and Pelletier. Pedotransfer functions from other packages (ptf.rawls\{soilwaterptf\}, euptf\{euptf\}) are applied to calculate soil characteristics.

## Input

DEM and shapefile of the catchment
